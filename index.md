**AI/ML + Software Development** 

I like to develop scalable AI systems with a focus on natural language processing(NLP) & deep learning. 
 
My MSc Data Science was focused on neural networks and its applications in NLP, Recommender Systems and their intersection. 

Previously, I worked full time as a software engineer for an AI startup, where I gained expertise in Angular, TypeScript & Python & contributing extensively to both frontend & backend of their SaaS.

Additionally, I'm a Microsoft certified Azure professional (AZ-900), with proficiency in various Azure services.
